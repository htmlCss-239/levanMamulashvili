        The Temple of Artemis, located in Ephesus (modern-day Turkey), was one
        of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Built around 550 BCE, it was
        dedicated to Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt. The temple was
        renowned for its size, featuring 127 massive marble columns, and housed
        a large statue of Artemis. Although it was destroyed and rebuilt several
        times throughout history, most notably by fire in 356 BCE, only a few
        remnants remain today. It was not only a religious center but also a
        place of refuge, where people could seek asylum.
