          Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Overview Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a
          popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and
          published by Moonton. Released in 2016, the game is designed primarily
          for mobile devices and has gained massive popularity worldwide,
          especially in Southeast Asia. In the game, players are divided into
          two teams of five and compete to destroy the enemy's base while
          defending their own. Each player controls a unique hero with special
          abilities and can choose different roles such as tank, marksman,
          assassin, mage, support, or fighter. Strategic teamwork, map
          awareness, and quick reflexes are essential for victory. The game
          features ranked matches, events, hero skins, and regular updates that
          introduce new heroes and gameplay changes.
